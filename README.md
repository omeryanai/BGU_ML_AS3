Instructions for running notebooks:

Make sure to change the HOME_DIR variable according to your environment path before running.

We found that high RAM GPU environemnt is needed for the CNN notebooks. 

Prequisites are tensorflow/keras, and torch.

1. Digit_Classification was tested on Google Colab
   
2. VGG19 was tested on BGU cluster
   
3. YOLOv5 was tested on Google Colab.
